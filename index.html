              <span>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> is a style sheet
              language used for describing the presentation of a document
              written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone
              technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
              content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
              improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and
              repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css
              file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages
              that share the file and its formatting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to
              present the same markup page in different styles for different
              rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
              speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
              tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
              the content is accessed on a mobile device.

          </header>
          <div>
            <p>
              CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to
              specify the names of various style properties. A style sheet
              consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one
              or more selectors, and a declaration block.
            </p>
            <h5>Selector</h5>
            <p>
              In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies
              to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
            </p>
            <p>Selectors may apply to the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers
                h2
              </li>
              <li>
                elements specified by attribute, in particular:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    id: an identifier unique within the document, identified
                    with a hash prefix e.g. <code>#id</code>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in
                    a document, identified with a period prefix e.g.
                    <code>.classname</code>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in
                the document tree.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can
              include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class
              may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may
              only be applied to a single element.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting
              based on information that is not contained in the document tree.
              One example of a widely used pseudo-class is <code>:hover</code>,
              which identifies content only when the user "points to" the
              visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It
              is appended to a selector as in <code>a:hover</code> or
              <code>#elementid:hover</code>. A pseudo-class classifies document
              elements, such as <code>:link</code> or <code>:visited</code>,
              whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of
              partial elements, such as <code>::first-line</code> or
              <code>::first-letter</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great
              specificity and flexibility. Multiple selectors may be joined in a
              spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id,
              class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is
              important. For example,
              <code>div .myClass {color: red;}</code> applies to all elements of
              class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas
              <code>.myClass div {color: red;}</code> applies to all div
              elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to
              be confused with concatenated identifiers such as div<code
                >.myClass {color: red;}</code
              >
              which applies to div elements of class myClass.
            </p>
            <h5>Declaration block</h5>
            <p>
              A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces.
              Each declaration itself consists of a property, a colon (:), and a
              value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon
              (;) must be inserted to separate each declaration. An optional
              semi-colon after the last (or single) declaration may be used.
            </p>
            <p>
              Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a
              set of possible values. Some properties can affect any type of
              element, and others apply only to particular groups of elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or
              numerical values, such as 200px (200 pixels), 50vw (50 percent of
              the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent element's
              width). Color values can be specified with keywords (e.g. "red"),
              hexadecimal values (e.g. #FF0000, also abbreviated as #F00), RGB
              values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255, 0, 0)), RGBA values that
              specify both color and alpha transparency (e.g. rgba(255, 0, 0,
              0.8)), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(000, 100%, 50%), hsla(000,
              100%, 50%, 80%)).
            </p>
            <h5>Use</h5>
            <p>
              Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents
              were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background
              styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly
              described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors
              move much of that information to another file, the style sheet,
              resulting in considerably simpler HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2),
              sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML.
              In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and
              emphasis for these elements is presentational. Before CSS,
              document authors who wanted to assign such typographic
              characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML
              presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type.
              This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and
              difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation
              from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size,
              borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic
              characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and
              printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading
              speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The W3C has now
              deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.
            </p>
            <h5>Sources</h5>
            <p>
              CSS information can be provided from various sources. These
              sources can be the web browser, the user and the author. The
              information from the author can be further classified into inline,
              media type, importance, selector specificity, rule order,
              inheritance and property definition. CSS style information can be
              in a separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML
              document. Multiple style sheets can be imported. Different styles
              can be applied depending on the output device being used; for
              example, the screen version can be quite different from the
              printed version, so that authors can tailor the presentation
              appropriately for each medium.

            <h4>Browser Support</h4>
          </header>
          <div>
            <p>
              Each web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages, and
              support for CSS functionality is not consistent between them.
              Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding
              techniques have been developed to target specific browsers with
              workarounds (commonly known as CSS hacks or CSS filters). Adoption
              of new functionality in CSS can be hindered by lack of support in
              major browsers. For example, Internet Explorer was slow to add
              support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed adoption of those
              features and damaged the browser's reputation among developers. In
              order to ensure a consistent experience for their users, web
              developers often test their sites across multiple operating
              systems, browsers, and browser versions, increasing development
              time and complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack have been built to
              reduce the complexity of maintaining these environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to these testing tools, many sites maintain lists of
              browser support for specific CSS properties, including CanIUse and
              the Mozilla Developer Network. Additionally, the CSS 3 defines
              feature queries, which provide an @supports directive that will
              allow developers to target browsers with support for certain
              functionality directly within their CSS. CSS that is not supported
              by older browsers can also sometimes be patched in using
              JavaScript polyfills, which are pieces of JavaScript code designed
              to make browsers behave consistently. These workarounds—and the
              need to support fallback functionality—can add complexity to
              development projects, and consequently, companies frequently
              define a list of browser versions that they will and will not
              support.
            </p>
            <p>
              As websites adopt newer code standards that are incompatible with
              older browsers, these browsers can be cut off from accessing many
              of the resources on the web (sometimes intentionally). Many of the
              most popular sites on the internet are not just visually degraded
              on older browsers due to poor CSS support, but do not work at all,
              in large part due to the evolution of JavaScript and other web
              technologies.

          </header>
          <div>
            <p>
              Some noted limitations of the current capabilities of CSS include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Selectors are unable to ascend</li>
              <p>
                CSS currently offers no way to select a parent or ancestor of an
                element that satisfies certain criteria. CSS Selectors Level 4,
                which is still in Working Draft status, proposes such a
                selector, but only as part of the complete "snapshot" selector
                profile, not the fast "live" profile used in dynamic CSS
                styling. A more advanced selector scheme (such as XPath) would
                enable more sophisticated style sheets. The major reasons for
                the CSS Working Group previously rejecting proposals for parent
                selectors are related to browser performance and incremental
                rendering issues.
              </p>
              <li>
                Cannot explicitly declare new scope independently of position
              </li>
              <p>
                Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the
                closest parent element with a position:absolute or
                position:relative attribute. This odd coupling has undesired
                effects. For example, it is impossible to avoid declaring a new
                scope when one is forced to adjust an element's position,
                preventing one from using the desired scope of a parent element.
              </p>
              <li>Pseudo-class dynamic behavior not controllable</li>
              <p>
                CSS implements pseudo-classes that allow a degree of user
                feedback by conditional application of alternate styles. One CSS
                pseudo-class, ":hover", is dynamic (equivalent of JavaScript
                "onmouseover") and has potential for misuse (e.g., implementing
                cursor-proximity popups), but CSS has no ability for a client to
                disable it (no "disable"-like property) or limit its effects (no
                "nochange"-like values for each property).
              </p>
              <li>Cannot name rules</li>
              <p>
                There is no way to name a CSS rule, which would allow (for
                example) client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its
                selector changes.
              </p>

            <h5>Separation of content from presentation</h5>
            <p>
              CSS facilitates publication of content in multiple presentation
              formats based on nominal parameters. Nominal parameters include
              explicit user preferences, different web browsers, the type of
              device being used to view the content (a desktop computer or
              mobile device), the geographic location of the user and many other
              variables.
            </p>
            <h5>Site-wide consistency</h5>
            <p>
              When CSS is used effectively, in terms of inheritance and
              "cascading", a global style sheet can be used to affect and style
              elements site-wide. If the situation arises that the styling of
              the elements should be changed or adjusted, these changes can be
              made by editing rules in the global style sheet. Before CSS, this
              sort of maintenance was more difficult, expensive and
              time-consuming.
            </p>
            <h5>Bandwidth</h5>
            <p>
              A stylesheet, internal or external, specifies the style once for a
              range of HTML elements selected by class, type or relationship to
              others. This is much more efficient than repeating style
              information inline for each occurrence of the element. An external
              stylesheet is usually stored in the browser cache, and can
              therefore be used on multiple pages without being reloaded,
              further reducing data transfer over a network.
            </p>
            <h5>Page reformatting</h5>
            <p>
              With a simple change of one line, a different style sheet can be
              used for the same page. This has advantages for accessibility, as
              well as providing the ability to tailor a page or site to
              different target devices. Furthermore, devices not able to
              understand the styling still display the content.
            </p>
            <h5>Accessibility</h5>
            Without CSS, web designers must typically lay out their pages with
            techniques such as HTML tables that hinder accessibility for
            vision-impaired users.

            <p>
              CSS frameworks are pre-prepared libraries that are meant to allow
              for easier, more standards-compliant styling of web pages using
              the Cascading Style Sheets language. CSS frameworks include
              Blueprint, Bootstrap, Foundation and Materialize. Like programming
              and scripting language libraries, CSS frameworks are usually
              incorporated as external .css sheets referenced in the HTML
              <code><span><</span><span>head</span><span>></span></code
              >. They provide a number of ready-made options for designing and
              laying out the web page. Although many of these frameworks have
              been published, some authors use them mostly for rapid
              prototyping, or for learning from, and prefer to 'handcraft' CSS
              that is appropriate to each published site without the design,
              maintenance and download overhead of having many unused features
              in the site's styling.

            <h5>Design methodologies</h5>
            <p>
              As the size of CSS resources used in a project increases, a
              development team often needs to decide on a common design
              methodology to keep them organized. The goals are ease of
              development, ease of collaboration during development and
              performance of the deployed stylesheets in the browser. Popular
              methodologies include OOCSS (object oriented CSS), ACSS (atomic
              CSS), oCSS (organic Cascade Style Sheet), SMACSS (scalable and
              modular architecture for CSS), and BEM (block, element, modifier).
