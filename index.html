          <h4>Introduction</h4>
        </header>
        <p>
          <span>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> is a style sheet language
          used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
          markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
          World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
          content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
          improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control
          in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable
          multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant
          CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition
          in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be
          cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share
          the file and its formatting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to
          present the same markup page in different styles for different
          rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
          speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
          devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content
          is accessed on a mobile device.
        </p>

      <!-- syntax -->
      <section class="main-section" id="syntax">
        <header>
          <h4>Syntax</h4>
        </header>
        <div>
          <p>
            CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to
            specify the names of various style properties. A style sheet
            consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one
            or more selectors, and a declaration block.
          </p>
          <h5>Selector</h5>
          <p>
            In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies
            to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
          </p>
          <p>Selectors may apply to the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers
              h2
            </li>
            <li>
              elements specified by attribute, in particular:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  id: an identifier unique within the document, identified
                  with a hash prefix e.g. <code>#id</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                  class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in
                  a document, identified with a period prefix e.g.
                  <code>.classname</code>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in
              the document tree.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can
            include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class
            may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may
            only be applied to a single element.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting
            based on information that is not contained in the document tree.
            One example of a widely used pseudo-class is <code>:hover</code>,
            which identifies content only when the user "points to" the
            visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It
            is appended to a selector as in <code>a:hover</code> or
            <code>#elementid:hover</code>. A pseudo-class classifies document
            elements, such as <code>:link</code> or <code>:visited</code>,
            whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of
            partial elements, such as <code>::first-line</code> or
            <code>::first-letter</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great
            specificity and flexibility. Multiple selectors may be joined in a
            spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id,
            class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is
            important. For example,
            <code>div .myClass {color: red;}</code> applies to all elements of
            class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas
            <code>.myClass div {color: red;}</code> applies to all div
            elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to
            be confused with concatenated identifiers such as div<code>.myClass {color: red;}</code>
            which applies to div elements of class myClass.
          </p>
          <h5>Declaration block</h5>
          <p>
            A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces.
            Each declaration itself consists of a property, a colon (:), and a
            value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon
            (;) must be inserted to separate each declaration. An optional
            semi-colon after the last (or single) declaration may be used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a
            set of possible values. Some properties can affect any type of
            element, and others apply only to particular groups of elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or
            numerical values, such as 200px (200 pixels), 50vw (50 percent of
            the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent element's
            width). Color values can be specified with keywords (e.g. "red"),
            hexadecimal values (e.g. #FF0000, also abbreviated as #F00), RGB
            values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255, 0, 0)), RGBA values that
            specify both color and alpha transparency (e.g. rgba(255, 0, 0,
            0.8)), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(000, 100%, 50%), hsla(000,
            100%, 50%, 80%)).
          </p>
          <h5>Use</h5>
          <p>
            Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents
            were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background
            styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly
            described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors
            move much of that information to another file, the style sheet,
            resulting in considerably simpler HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2),
            sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML.
            In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and
            emphasis for these elements is presentational. Before CSS,
            document authors who wanted to assign such typographic
            characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML
            presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type.
            This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and
            difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation
            from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size,
            borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic
            characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and
            printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading
            speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The W3C has now
            deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.
          </p>
          <h5>Sources</h5>
          <p>
            CSS information can be provided from various sources. These
            sources can be the web browser, the user and the author. The
            information from the author can be further classified into inline,
            media type, importance, selector specificity, rule order,
            inheritance and property definition. CSS style information can be
            in a separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML
            document. Multiple style sheets can be imported. Different styles
            can be applied depending on the output device being used; for
            example, the screen version can be quite different from the
            printed version, so that authors can tailor the presentation
            appropriately for each medium.

        <header>
          <h4>Browser Support</h4>
        </header>
        <div>
          <p>
            Each web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages, and
            support for CSS functionality is not consistent between them.
            Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding
            techniques have been developed to target specific browsers with
            workarounds (commonly known as CSS hacks or CSS filters). Adoption
            of new functionality in CSS can be hindered by lack of support in
            major browsers. For example, Internet Explorer was slow to add
            support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed adoption of those
            features and damaged the browser's reputation among developers. In
            order to ensure a consistent experience for their users, web
            developers often test their sites across multiple operating
            systems, browsers, and browser versions, increasing development
            time and complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack have been built to
            reduce the complexity of maintaining these environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to these testing tools, many sites maintain lists of
            browser support for specific CSS properties, including CanIUse and
            the Mozilla Developer Network. Additionally, the CSS 3 defines
            feature queries, which provide an @supports directive that will
            allow developers to target browsers with support for certain
            functionality directly within their CSS. CSS that is not supported
            by older browsers can also sometimes be patched in using
            JavaScript polyfills, which are pieces of JavaScript code designed
            to make browsers behave consistently. These workarounds—and the
            need to support fallback functionality—can add complexity to
            development projects, and consequently, companies frequently
            define a list of browser versions that they will and will not
            support.
          </p>
          <p>
            As websites adopt newer code standards that are incompatible with
            older browsers, these browsers can be cut off from accessing many
            of the resources on the web (sometimes intentionally). Many of the
            most popular sites on the internet are not just visually degraded
            on older browsers due to poor CSS support, but do not work at all,
            in large part due to the evolution of JavaScript and other web
            technologies.

        <header>
          <h4>Limitations</h4>
        </header>
        <div>
          <p>
            Some noted limitations of the current capabilities of CSS include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Selectors are unable to ascend</li>
            <p>
              CSS currently offers no way to select a parent or ancestor of an
              element that satisfies certain criteria. CSS Selectors Level 4,
              which is still in Working Draft status, proposes such a
              selector, but only as part of the complete "snapshot" selector
              profile, not the fast "live" profile used in dynamic CSS
              styling. A more advanced selector scheme (such as XPath) would
              enable more sophisticated style sheets. The major reasons for
              the CSS Working Group previously rejecting proposals for parent
              selectors are related to browser performance and incremental
              rendering issues.
            </p>
            <li>
              Cannot explicitly declare new scope independently of position
            </li>
            <p>
              Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the
              closest parent element with a position:absolute or
              position:relative attribute. This odd coupling has undesired
              effects. For example, it is impossible to avoid declaring a new
              scope when one is forced to adjust an element's position,
              preventing one from using the desired scope of a parent element.
            </p>
            <li>Pseudo-class dynamic behavior not controllable</li>
            <p>
              CSS implements pseudo-classes that allow a degree of user
              feedback by conditional application of alternate styles. One CSS
              pseudo-class, ":hover", is dynamic (equivalent of JavaScript
              "onmouseover") and has potential for misuse (e.g., implementing
              cursor-proximity popups), but CSS has no ability for a client to
              disable it (no "disable"-like property) or limit its effects (no
              "nochange"-like values for each property).
            </p>
            <li>Cannot name rules</li>
            <p>
              There is no way to name a CSS rule, which would allow (for
              example) client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its
              selector changes.
            </p>

          <h4>Advantages</h4>
        </header>
        <div>
          <h5>Separation of content from presentation</h5>
          <p>
            CSS facilitates publication of content in multiple presentation
            formats based on nominal parameters. Nominal parameters include
            explicit user preferences, different web browsers, the type of
            device being used to view the content (a desktop computer or
            mobile device), the geographic location of the user and many other
            variables.
          </p>
          <h5>Site-wide consistency</h5>
          <p>
            When CSS is used effectively, in terms of inheritance and
            "cascading", a global style sheet can be used to affect and style
            elements site-wide. If the situation arises that the styling of
            the elements should be changed or adjusted, these changes can be
            made by editing rules in the global style sheet. Before CSS, this
            sort of maintenance was more difficult, expensive and
            time-consuming.
          </p>
          <h5>Bandwidth</h5>
          <p>
            A stylesheet, internal or external, specifies the style once for a
            range of HTML elements selected by class, type or relationship to
            others. This is much more efficient than repeating style
            information inline for each occurrence of the element. An external
            stylesheet is usually stored in the browser cache, and can
            therefore be used on multiple pages without being reloaded,
            further reducing data transfer over a network.
          </p>
          <h5>Page reformatting</h5>
          <p>
            With a simple change of one line, a different style sheet can be
            used for the same page. This has advantages for accessibility, as
            well as providing the ability to tailor a page or site to
            different target devices. Furthermore, devices not able to
            understand the styling still display the content.
          </p>
          <h5>Accessibility</h5>
          Without CSS, web designers must typically lay out their pages with
          techniques such as HTML tables that hinder accessibility for
          vision-impaired users.

        <div>
          <h5>Frameworks</h5>
          <p>
            CSS frameworks are pre-prepared libraries that are meant to allow
            for easier, more standards-compliant styling of web pages using
            the Cascading Style Sheets language. CSS frameworks include
            Blueprint, Bootstrap, Foundation and Materialize. Like programming
            and scripting language libraries, CSS frameworks are usually
            incorporated as external .css sheets referenced in the HTML
            <code><span><</span><span>head</span><span>></span></code>. They provide a number of ready-made options for
            designing and
            laying out the web page. Although many of these frameworks have
            been published, some authors use them mostly for rapid
            prototyping, or for learning from, and prefer to 'handcraft' CSS
            that is appropriate to each published site without the design,
            maintenance and download overhead of having many unused features
            in the site's styling.
          </p>
          <h5>Design methodologies</h5>
          <p>
            As the size of CSS resources used in a project increases, a
            development team often needs to decide on a common design
            methodology to keep them organized. The goals are ease of
            development, ease of collaboration during development and
            performance of the deployed stylesheets in the browser. Popular
            methodologies include OOCSS (object oriented CSS), ACSS (atomic
            CSS), oCSS (organic Cascade Style Sheet), SMACSS (scalable and
            modular architecture for CSS), and BEM (block, element, modifier).
